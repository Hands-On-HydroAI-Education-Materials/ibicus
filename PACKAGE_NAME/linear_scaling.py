    """
    Class LinearScaling representing debiasing via so-called linear scaling following Maraun 2016 as reference.

    In linear scaling the present day model bias is either subtracted or divided from the future climate model time-series.
    Let :math:`y` be the observed timeseries :math:`x_{hist}` the simulated historical one and :math:`x_{fut}` the simulated future one (climate model historical and future run). Then additive linear scaling adjusts :math:`x_{fut}` as follows:

    .. math:: x_{fut} \\rightarrow x_{fut} - (\\text{mean}(x_{hist}) - \\text{mean}(y))

    and multiplicative scaling:

    .. math:: x_{fut} \\rightarrow x_{fut} * \\frac{\\text{mean}(y)}{\\text{mean}(x_{hist})}.


    Multiplicative scaling is hereby classically used for precipitation and additive scaling for temperature. Additive scaling amounts to a simple mean bias correction, whilst multiplicative one adjusts both mean and variance, but keeps their ration constant (Maraun 2016).

    Attributes
    ----------
    variable : str
        Variable for which the debiasing is used
    delta_type : str
        One of ["additive", "multiplicative"]. Determines whether additive or multiplicative scaling is used.


    Methods
    -------
    apply(obs: np.ndarray, cm_hist: np.ndarray, cm_future: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray
        Applies linear scaling at all given locations on a grid and returns the the debiased timeseries.
