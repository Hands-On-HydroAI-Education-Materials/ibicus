class LinearScaling(Debiaser):
    """
    Class LinearScaling representing debiasing via so-called linear scaling following Maraun 2016 as reference.

    In linear scaling the present day model bias is either subtracted or divided from the future climate model time-series.

    Let :math:`x_{\\text{obs}}` be the observed timeseries :math:`x_{\\text{cm_hist}}` the simulated historical one and :math:`x_{\\text{cm_fut}}` the simulated future one (climate model historical and future run). Then additive linear scaling adjusts :math:`x_{\\text{cm_fut}}` as follows:

    .. math:: x_{\\text{cm_fut}} \\rightarrow x_{\\text{cm_fut}} - (\\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}} - \\bar x_{\\text{obs}})

    and multiplicative scaling:

    .. math:: x_{\\text{cm_fut}} \\rightarrow x_{\\text{cm_fut}} * \\frac{\\bar x_{\\text{obs}}}{\\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}}}.

    Here :math:`\\bar x` stands for the mean over all x-values.

    Multiplicative scaling is classically used for precipitation and additive scaling for temperature. Additive scaling amounts to a simple mean bias correction, whilst multiplicative one adjusts both mean and variance, but keeps their ration constant (Maraun 2016).

    variable : str
        Variable for which the debiasing is used
    delta_type : str
        One of ["additive", "multiplicative"]. Determines whether additive or multiplicative scaling is used.
