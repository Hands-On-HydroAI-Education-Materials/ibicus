class DeltaChange(Debiaser):
    """
    Class DeltaChange representing debiasing via so-called delta change scaling following Maraun 2016 as reference.

    This is technically not a debiasing of a climate model because the future climate model output gets not directly transformed. Instead it only uses the models capturing of climate change to modify historical observations.

    Let :math:`x_{\\text{obs}}` be the observed timeseries :math:`x_{\\text{cm_hist}}` the simulated historical one and :math:`x_{\\text{cm_fut}}` the simulated future one (climate model historical and future run). Then in delta change a timeseries of future climate is generated as:

    .. math::  x_{\\text{obs}} +  (\\bar x_{\\text{cm_fut}} - \\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}})

    and for multiplicative change:

    .. math:: x_{\\text{obs}} * \\frac{\\bar x_{\\text{cm_fut}}}{\\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}}}.

    Here :math:`\\bar x` stands for the mean over all x-values.

    Multiplicative change is classically used for precipitation and additive scaling for temperature.

    Attributes
    ----------
    variable : str
        Variable for which the debiasing is used
    delta_type : str
        One of ["additive", "multiplicative"]. Determines whether additive or multiplicative scaling is used.

    apply(obs: np.ndarray, cm_hist: np.ndarray, cm_future: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray
