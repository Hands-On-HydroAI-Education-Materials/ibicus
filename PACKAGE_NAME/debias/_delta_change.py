class DeltaChange(Debiaser):
    """
    Class DeltaChange representing debiasing via so-called delta change scaling following Maraun 2016 as reference.

    This is technically not a debiasing of a climate model because the future climate model output gets not directly transformed. Instead it only uses the models capturing of climate change to modify historical observations.

    Let :math:`y` be the observed timeseries :math:`x_{hist}` the simulated historical one and :math:`x_{fut}` the simulated future one (climate model historical and future run). Then in delta change a timeseries of future climate is generated as:

    .. math::  y +  - (\\text{mean}(x_{fut}) - \\text{mean}(x_{hist}))

    and for multiplicative change:

    .. math:: y * \\frac{\\text{mean}(x_{fut})}{\\text{mean}(x_{hist})}.


    Multiplicative change is classically used for precipitation and additive scaling for temperature.

    Attributes
    ----------
    variable : str
        Variable for which the debiasing is used
    delta_type : str
        One of ["additive", "multiplicative"]. Determines whether additive or multiplicative scaling is used.


    Methods
    -------
    apply(obs: np.ndarray, cm_hist: np.ndarray, cm_future: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray
        Applies linear scaling at all given locations on a grid and returns the the debiased timeseries.
