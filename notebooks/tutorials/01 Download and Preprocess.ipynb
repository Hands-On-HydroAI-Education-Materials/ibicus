    "This notebook is intended to give an intro into how to download and preprocess climate data for climate model debiasing and further use. There are many ways to access climate data -- often on different temporal or spatial resolution (that might still be supported by PACKATE_NAME). This notebook is meant to illustrate one possible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply debiasing three datasets are needed: observations, often from a reanalasysis product but also other datasets are possible, to provide a baseline; historical climate model data in a reference period to compare with observations; and future climate model data that is debiased. Here we will use **CMIP6 data** from the Climate Data Store (CDS) as climate model input and download and preprocess two reanalysis as observations: 1) **ERA5** from the CDS and 2) **NCEP/DOE Reanalysis II** from the PSL datastore (NOAA).\n",
    "\n",
    "We work on daily temporal resolution here. Unfortunately not all CMIP6 models in the CDS are currently available on such resolution, so we need to select what covariates to use. Climate model processing and debiasing is of course also possible on monthly resolution: the choice here is mainly illustrative."
