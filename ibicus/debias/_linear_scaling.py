class LinearScaling(Debiaser):
    """
    |br| Implements debiasing via linear scaling based on Maraun 2016.

    Linear scaling corrects a climate model by the difference in the mean of observations and the mean of the climate model on the reference period, either additively or multiplicatively.


    The present day model bias is calculated and then either subtracted or divided from the future climate model data.

    Let :math:`x_{\\text{obs}}` be the observed timeseries :math:`x_{\\text{cm_hist}}` the simulated historical one and :math:`x_{\\text{cm_fut}}` the simulated future one (climate model historical and future run). Then additive linear scaling adjusts :math:`x_{\\text{cm_fut}}` as follows:

    .. math:: x_{\\text{cm_fut}} \\rightarrow x_{\\text{cm_fut}} - (\\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}} - \\bar x_{\\text{obs}})

    and multiplicative scaling:

    .. math:: x_{\\text{cm_fut}} \\rightarrow x_{\\text{cm_fut}} \\cdot \\frac{\\bar x_{\\text{obs}}}{\\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}}}.

    Here :math:`\\bar x` stands for the mean over all x-values.

    Multiplicative scaling is classically used for precipitation (`pr`) and additive scaling for temperature (`tas`). Additive scaling amounts to a simple mean bias correction, whilst multiplicative one adjusts both mean and variance, but keeps their ration constant (Maraun 2016).

    **Usage information:**

    - Default settings exist for: ``["hurs", "pr", "psl", "rlds", "rsds", "sfcWind", "tas", "tasmin", "tasmax"]``.

    - :py:func:`apply` requires: no additional arguments except ``obs``, ``cm_hist``, ``cm_future``.

    - The debiaser works with data in any time specification (daily, monthly, etc.).

    |br|
    **Examples:**

    >>> debiaser = DeltaChange.from_variable("tas")
    >>> debiaser.apply(obs, cm_hist, cm_future)

    Attributes
    ----------
    delta_type : str
        One of ``["additive", "multiplicative"]``. Determines whether additive or multiplicative scaling is used.

    running_window_mode : bool
        Iteration: Whether LinearScaling is used in running window mode to account for seasonalities. If ``running_window_mode = False`` then LinearScaling is applied on the whole period. Default: ``True``.
    running_window_length : int
        Iteration: Length of the running window in days: how many values are used to the debiased climate model values. Only relevant if ``running_window_mode = True``. Default: ``31``.
    running_window_step_length : int
        Iteration: Step length of the running window in days: how many values are debiased inside the running window. Only relevant if ``running_window_mode = True``. Default: ``1``.

    variable : str
        Variable for which the debiasing is used
